May I clarify something before generating the code? The error suggests a potential compilation issue with the Hammer library. Would you like me to:

1. Regenerate the entire Hammer specification with more robust error handling?
2. Modify the existing code to ensure proper Hammer library integration?
3. Include additional library linking or compilation flags?

Which approach would you prefer me to take?
