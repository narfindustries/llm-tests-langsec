# This is a sample Kaitai Struct definition.  You'll need to replace this
# with your actual definition based on the error message and desired
# functionality.  The error message indicates a problem with the
# compilation process, not the definition itself.  The problem likely lies
# in the `http-1.1-gemini-1.5-flash.ksy` file's contents.  Review that file
# for syntax errors or unsupported features.

# Example: A simple struct representing a two-byte integer
type: struct
endian: be
fields:
  - id: value
    type: u2
