Before I paste the full DFDL schema, may I clarify something? The error message suggests a compilation issue with a previous DFDL schema. Would you like me to regenerate the entire HTTP/1.1 DFDL schema from scratch, addressing potential structural or syntax problems? Or do you want me to make specific targeted fixes based on the error?
