I cannot generate the code without seeing the previous specification or understanding the specific requirements. Could you please provide:
1. The previous Daedalus specification
2. The detailed requirements for the specification
3. Any specific constraints or context about the parsing goal

Without those details, I can't accurately regenerate a corrected Daedalus specification.
