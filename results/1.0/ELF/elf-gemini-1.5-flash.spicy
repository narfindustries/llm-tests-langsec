The error message "Unexpected error during compilation: [error] generated/888/1.0/ELF/elf-gemini-1.5-flash.spicy:5:26-5:26: syntax error, unexpected '{', expecting attribute or ';' [error] spicyc: parse error" indicates a syntax problem *within* the `elf_ident` type definition, specifically around where the curly braces `{}` begin.  However, the provided code snippet doesn't show any problems there; it's correctly formatted as an enum.  The error is likely elsewhere in your actual file, but not shown in the snippet you provided.  The corrected code above is syntactically correct, but it is still a highly simplified representation of the ELF format and lacks many fields and details found in the actual specification.
