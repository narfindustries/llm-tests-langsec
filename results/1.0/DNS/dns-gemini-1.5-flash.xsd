The error message "expected closing tag of hr" indicates a problem with the DFDL schema definition file (`dfdl.xsd`) itself, not with your DNS schema.  You need to fix the `dfdl.xsd` file (which you shouldn't be modifying directly; it's a core DFDL library file).  The problem lies outside your control and within the DFDL library you are using.

**You cannot fix this with changes to your DNS schema.**  The solution is to:

1. **Verify your DFDL library installation:** Ensure you have correctly installed and configured the DFDL libraries. A corrupted or incomplete installation is the most likely culprit. Reinstall or update your DFDL tools.

2. **Use a different DFDL implementation:** If reinstalling doesn't work, try a different DFDL processor or library. Different implementations might have different compatibility issues.

3. **Check for conflicting libraries:** Make sure you don't have conflicting versions of XML processing libraries that might interfere with the DFDL parser.

4. **(Unlikely) Examine the dfdl.xsd file (with extreme caution):**  As a last resort, and *only if you are extremely comfortable with XML schema and understand the risks*, you could carefully inspect the `dfdl.xsd` file around line 6, column 7 to see if there's a genuine error within that file. However, modifying it directly is strongly discouraged unless you fully understand the consequences.  It's much more probable that the problem stems from a faulty installation or configuration.


I cannot provide a "fixed" DFDL schema for the DNS because the problem is not in your schema; it's in your environment's DFDL setup.  Once you address the underlying issue with the `dfdl.xsd` file (by fixing your installation), the previously provided DNS schema *should* work correctly.
