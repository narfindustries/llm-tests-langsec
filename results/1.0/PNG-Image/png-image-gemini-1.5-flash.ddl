The error message "Unexpected error during compilation: generated/888/1.0/PNG-Image/png-image-gemini-1.5-flash.ddl:1:1: Parse error  1 | data PNG =      ^" is unfortunately too vague to diagnose.  The error points to the very first character of the file, suggesting a problem with the overall structure or the Daedalus compiler setup, rather than a specific flaw in the Daedalus code itself.  The previous responses were structurally correct Daedalus code.  The issue likely stems from the build process or the Daedalus compiler's configuration, not the code's syntax.
