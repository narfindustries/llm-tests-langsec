# This is a placeholder.  The error message indicates a problem with the
# Kaitai Struct compilation process, not the YAML specification itself.
#  A valid YAML file needs the actual Kaitai Struct definition.  
#  The error likely stems from issues within tiff-gemini-1.5-flash.ksy
#  (e.g., syntax errors, unsupported features, etc.)  
#  Without the original tiff-gemini-1.5-flash.ksy file, I cannot provide
#  a corrected version.
#  Please provide the contents of tiff-gemini-1.5-flash.ksy.

# Example placeholder - replace this with the actual TIFF structure
