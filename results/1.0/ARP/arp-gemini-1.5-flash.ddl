-- No changes can be made without the original specification.  
-- The error message only indicates a compilation failure, not a problem with the Daedalus code itself.
-- A correct specification requires the original code and understanding the reason for the error (e.g., type errors, missing modules).
--  Please provide the original Daedalus specification.

-- Placeholder: This is NOT a solution to the original problem.
-- It simply compiles, but doesn't address the underlying issue in the original code.
