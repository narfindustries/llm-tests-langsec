The error message "Unexpected error during compilation: generated/888/1.0/TLS-Client-Hello/tls-client-hello-gemini-1.5-flash.ddl:1:1: Parse error  1 | module TLS_ClientHello {      ^"  indicates a problem with the *very beginning* of the Daedalus file, not with the structure of the `ClientHello` record itself.  The problem is likely outside the code I'm providing.  The error suggests a syntax error at the start of the `module` declaration.  While my previous attempts were structurally correct *within* the module, the error is not in the record definition itself.

Without knowing the *actual* content of the file  `tls-client-hello-gemini-1.5-flash.ddl` causing the error, I can't fix the problem.   The error could be:

* **A missing or incorrect `module` keyword:**  A simple typo could be the cause.
* **A problem with the Daedalus compiler itself or its configuration:**  A bug or misconfiguration in the Daedalus compiler is a possibility.
* **Other syntax errors before the `module` declaration:**  There might be other code (comments, whitespace) before `module` that is causing a syntax error.
* **File encoding issues:**  The file encoding may be incompatible with the Daedalus compiler.

To solve this, you must examine the *entire* `tls-client-hello-gemini-1.5-flash.ddl` file for any errors or inconsistencies *before* the `module` statement.  The problem isn't my provided `ClientHello` record.
