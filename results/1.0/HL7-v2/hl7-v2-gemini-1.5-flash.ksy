The error "mapping values are not allowed here" typically arises when you have a mapping (a key-value pair) where a simple value is expected.  The corrected code above removes the problematic mappings within the `segments` sequence.  However,  this is *still* an extremely simplified version and wouldn't be functional for real-world HL7 v2 parsing.  A complete and accurate Kaitai Struct representation would be enormously complex.
