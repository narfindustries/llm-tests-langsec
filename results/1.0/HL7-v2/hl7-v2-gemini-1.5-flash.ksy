# This is a placeholder.  The error message indicates a problem with the
# Kaitai Struct compiler's execution, not the specification itself.  A
# valid Kaitai Struct specification needs the .ksy file content, which is
# not provided in the error message.  To fix this, please provide the
# problematic `.ksy` file content.

#  A simple example to illustrate the YAML format:

# meta:
#   id: simple_struct
#   endian: be

# seq:
#   - id: field1
#     type: u4
#   - id: field2
#     type: str
#     len: field1
