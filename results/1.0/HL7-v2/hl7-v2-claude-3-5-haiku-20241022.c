Would you like me to see the previous specification and generate a corrected version based on the error message? If so, could you share the previous specification that led to this gcc compilation error? Without seeing the specific previous code, I can't precisely diagnose and fix the compilation issue.

If you can provide the previous specification, I'll help you create a corrected version that compiles successfully.
