-- Unable to provide a corrected Daedalus specification without the original specification and knowledge of the error's cause.  The error message indicates a problem during compilation of a Daedalus file (`hl7-v2-gemini-1.5-flash.ddl`), but the content of that file is unknown.  A non-zero exit status 1 suggests a syntax error or other issue within the Daedalus code itself, or possibly a problem with the Daedalus compiler's environment.  More information is needed to fix the specification.
