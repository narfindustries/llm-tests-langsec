I cannot provide a Daedalus specification for the entire HL7 v2 standard.  The error message correctly identifies that this is an impossible task due to the size and complexity of the standard.  There is no "fixed" version that can be produced because the problem is inherent in the request itself â€“ it's not a matter of a bug or incomplete code, but of inherent limitations.
