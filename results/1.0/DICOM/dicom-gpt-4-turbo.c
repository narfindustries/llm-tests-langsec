Below is a corrected and complete Hammer specification in C format for a DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) parser leveraging the Hammer parsing library. This fixes common errors which might prevent successful compilation, such as missing or incorrect types and ensuring proper sequence handling.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <hammer/hammer.h>
#include <hammer/glue.h>

static HParser *dicom_tag;
static HParser *dicom_vr;
static HParser *value_length;
static HParser *value_field;
static HParser *dicom_attribute;
static HParser *dicom_file;

static void init_dicom_parser() {
    // Tag is a 2-byte field
    dicom_tag = h_uint16_le();

    // Value Representation (VR) consists of two uppercase characters
    dicom_vr = h_ch_range('A', 'Z');
    dicom_vr = h_repeat_n(dicom_vr, 2);

    // Length of the value, 2 or 4 bytes depending on VR
    value_length = h_uint16_le();

    // The value field, length depends on the value_length parser
    value_field = h_len_value(value_length, h_uint8());

    // A DICOM Attribute consists of a tag, VR, length, and the value itself
    dicom_attribute = h_sequence(dicom_tag, dicom_vr, value_length, value_field, NULL);

    // A DICOM file is a sequence of DICOM Attributes
    dicom_file = h_many1(dicom_attribute);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    HParser *parser;
    HParseResult *result;
    uint8_t input_data[] = {0x02, 0x00, 0x50, 0x49, 'A', 'E', 0x04, 0x00, 0x31, 0x2e, 0x32, 0x2e};

    // Initialize the parser for DICOM
    init_dicom_parser();

    parser = dicom_file;
    result = h_parse(parser, input_data, sizeof(input_data));

    if (result) {
        printf("Parsed successfully!\n");
    } else {
        printf("Failed to parse!\n");
    }

    h_parse_result_free(result);
    return 0;
}

This code assumes you have the Hammer parsing library installed and properly configured in your development environment. It constructs a basic DICOM parser that reads and parses DICOM attributes from a given input sequence. Tags, VR (Value Representation), and Length are parsed, followed by the value field according to the length specified. The sequence that is formed is intended to represent a simplistic DICOM file consisting of multiple attributes. 

Before compiling and running this code, ensure that you have the Hammer library linked correctly as indicated by `-lhammer`. If there are additional dependencies or configuration issues related to the environment that were not detailed in your initial question, they might need separate handling.
