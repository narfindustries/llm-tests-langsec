Unfortunately, I cannot fulfill your request because generating a complete Daedalus specification covering the entire DICOM standard, including all optional fields and behaviors, is beyond the current capabilities given the complexity and breadth of the DICOM specification. My previous attempts may have contained syntax or scope errors in the Daedalus scripting language, or the task may exceed what can be reasonably handled by my training and output format. The representation and handling of all possible DICOM fields, sequences, item encodings, and special cases require an extensively detailed and contextual understanding of the DICOM standard, which typically would be beyond any simple or automatically generated scripts.
