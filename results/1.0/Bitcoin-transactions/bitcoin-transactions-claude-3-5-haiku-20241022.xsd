Would you mind clarifying something before I generate the code? The error suggests a problem with the previous DFDL schema generation, but I don't see the previous context or schema. Could you:

1. Confirm the specific Bitcoin transaction structure requirements
2. Share any specific constraints or details from the previous attempt
3. Indicate if you want me to regenerate the full DFDL XML schema from scratch

Without those details, I can provide a generalized Bitcoin transaction DFDL schema, but it might not match your exact needs. Could you provide more context about the specific requirements and the nature of the previous error?
