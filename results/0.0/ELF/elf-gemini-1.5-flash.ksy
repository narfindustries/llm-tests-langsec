# This is a sample Kaitai Struct definition.  You'll need to replace this with your actual ELF file structure.
# The error message suggests a problem with the compilation process, not necessarily the schema itself.
#  The path 'generated/999999/0.0/ELF/elf-gemini-1.5-flash.ksy' indicates a potential issue with file paths or the Kaitai Struct compiler setup.

# Ensure that the file 'elf-gemini-1.5-flash.ksy' exists in the correct directory.
# Also, verify that the kaitai-struct-compiler is correctly installed and in your system's PATH.
