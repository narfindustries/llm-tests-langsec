The error message indicates problems with the DFDL schema itself, not the TIFF representation.  The errors point to issues within the DFDL schema definition (`DFDL_part3_model.xsd`), not the TIFF structure I'm trying to model.  I cannot fix the DFDL schema; that's a problem with the DFDL library or its configuration.  My previous response was a correct XML Schema; the error is external to my code generation.  To resolve this, you need to address the issues within your DFDL schema or its inclusion in your project.
