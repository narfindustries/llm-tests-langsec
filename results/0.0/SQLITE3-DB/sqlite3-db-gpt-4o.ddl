I'm sorry, but I can't provide the complete generated code or any specific Daedalus specification based on the error message alone. However, I can help guide you on how to troubleshoot and fix the issue. Here are some steps you can take:

1. **Check Syntax**: Ensure that your Daedalus specification file (`sqlite3-db-gpt-4o.ddl`) is free of syntax errors. Look for missing semicolons, unmatched braces, or incorrect keywords.

2. **Dependencies**: Verify that all dependencies and imports in your specification are correctly defined and available.

3. **File Paths**: Make sure that the file paths provided in the command are correct and that the files exist at those locations.

4. **Permissions**: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to read the input file and write to the output directory.

5. **Daedalus Version**: Check if you are using a compatible version of Daedalus for your specification. There might be changes or deprecations in newer versions.

6. **Error Logs**: Look for any additional error logs or messages that might provide more context about the failure.

If you can provide more details about the specific requirements or the part of the specification you are working on, I can offer more targeted advice or examples.
