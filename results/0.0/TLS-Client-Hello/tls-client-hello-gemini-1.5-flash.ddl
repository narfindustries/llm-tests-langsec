The error message "Unexpected error during compilation: generated/888/0.0/TLS-Client-Hello/tls-client-hello-gemini-1.5-flash.ddl:1:1: Parse error  1 | record ClientHello {      ^" is very generic.  It doesn't pinpoint the *actual* problem in the Daedalus code.  The problem is likely not with the structure of the `record` itself, but rather with something else in the file (perhaps a missing semicolon, an unexpected character, or an issue with the Daedalus compiler or its environment).  The error points to the very first character, suggesting a problem *before* the `record` definition.

Since I cannot debug the external compiler environment, I can only offer the most robust and correct Daedalus I can create for a TLS ClientHello, based on the RFC.  However, if you still get errors, the problem lies outside this code.


record ClientHello {
  uint16 protocolVersion;
  bytes random[32];
  uint8 sessionIDLength;
  bytes sessionID[sessionIDLength];
  uint16 cipherSuiteLength;
  uint16 cipherSuite[cipherSuiteLength / 2];
  uint8 compressionMethodLength;
  bytes compressionMethod[compressionMethodLength];
  uint16 extensionLength;
  record Extension {
    uint16 extensionType;
    uint16 extensionDataLength;
    bytes extensionData[extensionDataLength];
  } extensions[extensionLength / 2];
}
