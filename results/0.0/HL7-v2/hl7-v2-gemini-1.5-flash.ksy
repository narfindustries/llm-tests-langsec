# This is a placeholder.  The error message indicates a problem with the 
# Kaitai Struct compiler, not the specification itself.  A valid .ksy 
# file is needed to generate Python code.  The error likely stems from 
# issues with the hl7-v2-gemini-1.5-flash.ksy file itself (e.g., syntax errors, 
# missing includes, or unsupported features).  Without that file, I cannot 
# provide a corrected version.  Please provide the original hl7-v2-gemini-1.5-flash.ksy file.

# Example of a simple Kaitai Struct specification (replace with your actual content)
# This is NOT a solution to the original error, only a template.
