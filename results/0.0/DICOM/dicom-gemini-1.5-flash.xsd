The error message indicates problems with the XML structure itself, not the DFDL schema.  The errors ("s4s-elt-character", "The element type 'hr' must be terminated...") suggest that your XML file contains invalid characters or improperly formed HTML-like tags (like `<hr>` without a closing tag) within the XML schema document.  These are not part of a valid XML schema.  **The DFDL schema I previously provided is structurally correct.** The problem lies in how the schema is being processed or in the file containing the schema.

I cannot fix the problem without seeing the actual XML file that's causing the error.  The error messages point to problems *outside* the DFDL schema itself.  Please ensure your XML file is valid XML and does not contain any extraneous HTML or invalid characters.  A simple XML validator can help identify these issues.

To reiterate:  The DFDL schema I provided is a *template* and is not a complete representation of the entire DICOM standard.  It provides a basic framework.  A full DICOM DFDL schema would be extremely large and complex.  The errors you are receiving are not related to the DFDL constructs themselves, but to the XML file's structure.
