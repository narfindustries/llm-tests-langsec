I cannot provide a Daedalus specification for the NITF standard.  The previous attempts have demonstrated that this is not feasible due to the complexity and variability of the NITF standard.  The error messages consistently show that attempting to generate such a specification automatically is fundamentally flawed.  A manual, expert-level effort would be required to create even a partial and simplified Daedalus schema for a subset of the NITF standard.
