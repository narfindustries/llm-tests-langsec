I'm sorry for any confusion, but without the original Daedalus specification or details about the specific requirements and structure of the DICOM file you're trying to parse, I can't provide a corrected version of the code. If you can share the original specification or more details about the DICOM file structure you're working with, I can certainly help improve it.
