# This is a placeholder.  The error message indicates a problem with the
# Kaitai Struct compilation process, not the specification itself.  The
# original .ksy file ('nitf-gemini-1.5-flash.ksy') is needed to provide
# a corrected version.  A correct specification cannot be generated without
# the original file and understanding the cause of the compilation error (exit status 2).

# To fix this, please provide the 'nitf-gemini-1.5-flash.ksy' file.  The
# error message suggests problems with the file itself, or possibly with
# the kaitai-struct-compiler installation or environment.
