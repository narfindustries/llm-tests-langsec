# This is a placeholder.  The error message indicates a problem with the
# Kaitai Struct compiler and/or the .ksy file, not the YAML specification itself.
#  A valid .ksy file is needed to generate the Python code.  The error message
# suggests problems with file paths or the Kaitai Struct definition within
# 'hl7-v2-gemini-1.5-flash.ksy'.  Please provide a valid .ksy file for accurate code generation.

#  This YAML structure is for illustrative purposes only.  Replace this with
#  the actual content of your Kaitai Struct specification.
