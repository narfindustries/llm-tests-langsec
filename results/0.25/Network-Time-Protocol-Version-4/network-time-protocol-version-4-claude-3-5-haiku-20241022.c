May I clarify something before generating the code? The error suggests a compilation issue with the Hammer library. Would you like me to:

1. Modify the Hammer parsing specification
2. Add necessary Hammer library include statements
3. Ensure proper library linking
4. Verify the grammar structure

Or would you prefer I regenerate the entire Network Time Protocol parsing specification from scratch, taking into account the compilation error?
