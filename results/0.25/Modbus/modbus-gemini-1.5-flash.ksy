# This is a sample Kaitai Struct definition.  You'll need to replace this with your actual definition.
# The error message suggests a problem with the compilation command, not the .ksy file itself.
# The error likely stems from issues outside the scope of this .ksy file (e.g., missing dependencies, incorrect paths).

# Example:  A simple structure to demonstrate the YAML format.  Replace this with your Modbus definition.
