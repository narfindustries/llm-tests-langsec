I understand you want me to provide a corrected Daedalus specification based on the error message. However, the error message doesn't provide specific details about what went wrong in the previous specification. Without more context about the specific compilation error, I can't confidently generate a fixed version.

Would you be willing to share:
1. The previous Daedalus specification
2. More details about the error
3. The specific requirements for the GIF generation

With those details, I can help craft a precise, corrected Daedalus specification.
