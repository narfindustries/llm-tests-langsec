# This is a placeholder.  The error message indicates a problem with the 
# Kaitai Struct compiler, not the specification itself.  A valid .ksy 
# file is needed to generate code.  The error likely stems from issues 
# within `hl7-v2-gemini-1.5-flash.ksy` (e.g., syntax errors, missing 
# definitions, or unsupported features).  Without the original .ksy file, 
# I cannot provide a corrected version.  Please provide the original 
# `hl7-v2-gemini-1.5-flash.ksy` file for accurate correction.
