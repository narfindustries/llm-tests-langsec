# This is a placeholder.  The error message indicates a problem with the 
# Kaitai Struct compiler and/or the input `.ksy` file (dicom-gemini-1.5-flash.ksy),
# not the YAML specification itself.  A valid YAML specification requires the
# actual content of the dicom-gemini-1.5-flash.ksy file to be properly represented.
#  The error message "returned non-zero exit status 2" suggests a syntax error
# or other issue within the `.ksy` file that needs to be resolved before a 
# correct YAML representation can be provided.

#  To get a valid YAML specification, please provide the contents of 
#  'generated/999999/0.25/DICOM/dicom-gemini-1.5-flash.ksy'.
