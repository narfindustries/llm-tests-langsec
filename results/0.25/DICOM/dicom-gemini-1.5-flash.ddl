-- Unable to provide a fixed Daedalus specification without the original specification and details about the error.  The error message indicates a problem with the compilation of a Daedalus file (`dicom-gemini-1.5-flash.ddl`), but doesn't provide information about the content of that file or the nature of the compilation error.  A correct solution requires the original `dicom-gemini-1.5-flash.ddl` file.
