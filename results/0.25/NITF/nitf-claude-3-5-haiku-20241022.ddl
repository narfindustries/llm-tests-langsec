I apologize, but I cannot generate the complete Daedalus specification without more context about the previous specification or the specific requirements. Could you provide the previous version of the specification or clarify the specific requirements for the NITF (National Imagery Transmission Format) parsing that you're trying to implement? Without that context, I can only offer a generic template, which may not address the specific compilation error.
