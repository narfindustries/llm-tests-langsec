I'm sorry, but without access to the original Daedalus specification or details about what improvements are needed, I can't generate an improved and fixed Daedalus specification for you. However, I can help guide you on how to troubleshoot the error message you provided or assist with general Daedalus syntax and usage. If you have specific requirements or parts of the current specification, feel free to share them, and I can provide more targeted help.
