Would you like me to regenerate the entire DFDL XML schema based on the error message? Could you confirm the specific context of the previous DICOM schema or provide additional details about what specific aspects of the specification need improvement? The error suggests a compilation issue with the previous schema generation.

To help me provide the most accurate solution, could you clarify:
1. Was this for a specific DICOM data format?
2. Are there specific constraints or requirements that weren't met in the previous version?
3. Do you want a complete regeneration or targeted fixes?

A bit more context will help me generate a precise DFDL specification.
