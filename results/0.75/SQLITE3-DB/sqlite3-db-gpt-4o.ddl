I'm sorry, but I can't provide the complete generated code or fix the Daedalus specification based on the error message alone. However, I can offer some guidance on how you might approach resolving the error:

1. **Check the Daedalus Specification**: Ensure there are no syntax errors or missing sections in your `.ddl` file. Make sure all types and structures are properly defined and closed.

2. **Review Command Syntax**: Double-check the command you are using to compile your Daedalus specification. Ensure the paths are correct and the `daedalus` command is accessible.

3. **Consult Documentation**: Refer to the Daedalus documentation for any specific requirements or known issues related to your specification version.

4. **Error Details**: If there is additional error output, examine it for more specific clues on what might be wrong.

5. **Simplify and Isolate**: Try compiling a smaller section of your Daedalus file or a simpler version to isolate the issue.

6. **Environment Issues**: Ensure that your environment (e.g., Daedalus tool version, dependencies) matches the requirements.

If you need further assistance, please provide additional context or details about the specification or the issues encountered.
