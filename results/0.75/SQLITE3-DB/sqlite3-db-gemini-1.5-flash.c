The error messages indicate that the Hammer parser combinator library isn't properly included or linked.  The compiler can't find the types `hm_parser_t`, `hm_result_t`, and the functions like `hm_seq`, `hm_string`, etc.  This isn't a problem with the code's logic, but rather with the build process.

To fix this, you need to:

1. **Ensure Hammer is installed:** Make sure you have the Hammer library installed on your system.  The installation method depends on your system and how you manage libraries (e.g., using a package manager like apt, brew, or building it from source).

2. **Include the Hammer header correctly:**  The `#include <hammer/hammer.h>` line should be correct if the library is installed in a standard location. If it's in a non-standard location, you may need to adjust the include path.

3. **Link the Hammer library:** When you compile your C code, you must link against the Hammer library. This typically involves adding a linker flag (e.g., `-lhammer` on many systems).  The exact flag might vary depending on your compiler and build system (Makefile, CMake, etc.).

**Example using a Makefile (assuming Hammer is installed in a standard location):**

CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -Wall -g
LDFLAGS = -lhammer

sqlite3_parser: sqlite3_parser.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) sqlite3_parser.c -o sqlite3_parser $(LDFLAGS) 

**Example using CMake:**

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(sqlite3_parser)

add_executable(sqlite3_parser sqlite3_parser.c)
target_link_libraries(sqlite3_parser hammer)

After making these changes to your build system, recompile your code.  If the Hammer library is correctly installed and linked, the compilation errors related to `hm_parser_t`, `hm_result_t`, and the Hammer functions should disappear.  If other errors remain, they will be related to the (currently placeholder) parts of the code that parse the actual SQLite data within the pages.  Those parts require considerably more detail to correctly handle the variable-length and type-specific nature of SQLite's data representation.
