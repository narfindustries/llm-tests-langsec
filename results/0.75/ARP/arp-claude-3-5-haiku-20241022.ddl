I apologize, but I cannot generate the complete code without context about the previous specification or the specific requirements. Could you provide:
1. The previous Daedalus specification
2. The specific requirements for the ARP specification
3. Any additional context about the compilation error

Without those details, I can only offer a generic placeholder, which would not be helpful. If you share more information, I can help you craft a correct Daedalus specification.
