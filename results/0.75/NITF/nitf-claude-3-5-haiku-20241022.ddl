May I clarify something? Your request seems to imply there was a previous specification that generated an error, but I don't see the prior context. Could you share the previous Daedalus specification that resulted in this compilation error? Without seeing the original code, I can't diagnose or improve the specific issue.

If you'd like me to help, could you:
1. Paste the previous Daedalus specification
2. Describe what the specification was intended to do
3. Share any specific requirements or constraints

This will help me provide an accurate, corrected Daedalus specification.
