--  I cannot provide a corrected Daedalus specification without knowing the 
--  original specification that produced the error. The error message only 
--  indicates a compilation failure, not the nature of the problem within the 
--  Daedalus code itself.  The "nitf-gemini-1.5-flash.ddl" file contents are crucial.

-- To help me generate a correct specification, please provide:

-- 1. The original `nitf-gemini-1.5-flash.ddl` file contents.
-- 2.  A description of what the Daedalus code is supposed to do.  What data structure 
--     is it supposed to represent? What are the expected inputs and outputs?
-- 3. The intended purpose of the compilation step (what is the target language/format?).

--  This placeholder demonstrates a simple Daedalus program.  Replace this with your actual code.

type MyType = { a :: Integer, b :: String }

main :: Daedalus.AST.Program
main = do
  let x = MyType 123 "hello"
  return x
