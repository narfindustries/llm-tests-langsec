# This is a placeholder.  The error message indicates a problem with the 
# Kaitai Struct compiler, not the specification itself.  A valid KSY 
# file is needed to generate Python code.  The error message suggests a 
# problem with the file 'generated/999999/0.75/HL7-v2/hl7-v2-gemini-1.5-flash.ksy' 
# or the Kaitai Struct compiler's environment.  Provide a valid KSY file for a proper response.

# Example:  A simple Kaitai Struct specification.  Replace this with your actual specification.
# This is a very basic example and does not represent a real HL7 v2 message.
