I cannot generate the full code without context about the previous specification, error details, or specific requirements. Could you provide the prior context about the Hammer specification, the specific error details, or the original requirements? Without those details, I can only offer a generic response that may not resolve the specific compilation issue.

Would you be willing to share:
1. The original Hammer specification
2. Full error message details
3. The specific parsing or grammar requirements
