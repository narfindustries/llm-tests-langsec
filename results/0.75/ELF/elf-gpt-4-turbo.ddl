I don't have access to the specific content of the `.ddl` file mentioned in your error message ("elf-gpt-4-turbo.ddl"), and without that, I can't generate or fix the Daedalus specification directly. However, I can help you to understand and potentially resolve the error by guiding you on common issues related to such compilation errors in Daedalus.

To proceed, you would need to check the content of the `.ddl` file for syntax errors, dependencies issues, or incorrect data types that might be causing the compilation to fail. If you can provide the content of the `.ddl` file, I could offer more specific advice or corrections.
