The error "Unexpected error during compilation: [error] generated/888/0.75/ELF/elf-gemini-1.5-flash.spicy:5:26-5:26: syntax error, unexpected '{', expecting attribute or ';' [error] spicyc: parse error" indicates a problem with the syntax within a `record` definition, likely related to missing semicolons or incorrect placement of curly braces.  The provided solution ensures each field in the `record` types is properly terminated with a semicolon.  The use of `|` in the `array of` declarations is also corrected to use `|` for union types as opposed to `/` which is not the correct syntax in this context.  This should resolve the compilation error.  However, note that this still represents a *highly simplified* version of the ELF specification; a truly complete representation would be extremely large and complex.
