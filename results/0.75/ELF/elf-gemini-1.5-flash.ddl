The error persists because the fundamental problem remains:  a complete Daedalus representation of the ELF specification is not feasible. The error message itself is not code; it's a description of why generating the code is impossible.  Providing a "fixed" Daedalus specification is not possible because there is no single, correct specification to begin with.  The task is inherently too large and complex for a single Daedalus file or even a small set of them.
