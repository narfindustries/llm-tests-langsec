Q: Let us assume you are a developer who has already read RFC 5905 for the Network Time Protocol version 4. Can you now write the specification for NTP in the YAML syntax for Kaitai Struct?

A: Certainly! Below is a specification for the Network Time Protocol (NTP) version 4 in YAML syntax for Kaitai Struct. This specification assumes that you have already read RFC 5905 and are familiar with the structure of NTP packets.

### Explanation:

- **header**: This section defines the main NTP header, which includes fields like `leap_indicator`, `version`, `mode`, `stratum`, `poll`, `precision`, `root_delay`, `root_dispersion`, `reference_id`, and timestamps (`reference_timestamp`, `originate_timestamp`, `receive_timestamp`, `transmit_timestamp`).

- **extensions**: This section defines the optional extension fields that can be included in the NTP packet. It includes a count of extension fields and a list of `extension_field` structures.

- **extension_field**: Each extension field has a type, length, and data.

- **timestamp**: This type is used to represent the NTP timestamps, which consist of a seconds part and a fraction part.

- **enums**: This section defines the possible values for `leap_indicator`, `version`, and `mode` fields, as specified in RFC 5905.

This YAML specification can be used with Kaitai Struct to parse NTP version 4 packets.
